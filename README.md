# spendings
This will be the class that allows you to add, edit, or delete a transaction within the table. 

It will keep track of the total amount of transactions: double totalTransactions

Within the "class Spendings" there will be a "struct Transactions" that will contain the name, category, and amount (and possibly date)
for each individual Transaction. 
These transactions will be stored in a vector: transactions: vector<Transactions> (corresponding to the table)
